<body>Q. I have installed DocSearch plus, but I cannot find anything. What are the correct steps to use it?<br><br>A. Before starting your first search, you need to create indexes for your files. Please follow &nbsp;the steps below:<br>(You can also refer to "Menu-&gt;Help-&gt;Brief User Guide-&gt;Page 2 &amp; 3 for details")<br><br>Step 1: <br>Create the indexes via:<br>Menu -&gt;"Create/Maintain index"-&gt;"Create/Remove index manually"-&gt;"Create filename index" and "Create file content index"<br><br>You will see the following screen and follow the instructions described in the screenshot.<br><br><img style="width: 384px; height: 768px;" alt="" src="1.png"><br><br>Step 2:<br>Use a keyword to search your files on the main screen of this app.<br><br>Detailed steps as following:<br>1. Enter keywords (e.g. "happy")<br>2. Press the blue "search icon" on the right.<br>3. All files containing "happy" will show.<br>4. Click the file name, you can see the file content in the lower half of the screen.<br>(For more functions on the main screen, please refer to "Menu -&gt; Help -&gt; Brief User Guide -&gt; Page 5")<br><br><img style="width: 384px; height: 768px;" alt="" src="2.png"><br><br><br>Q: If I don&#8217;t know where my files on the device are, how do I specify the folder when creating the index?<br><br>A: You can create indexes via:<br>Menu -&gt;"Create/Maintain index"-&gt;"Create/Remove index manually"-&gt;"Create filename index" and "Scan all files to index"<br><br>The
function of "Scan all files to index" will scan the entire device and
list all folders containing any supported files. You can select one or
more folders to index. <br><br>If you still have no idea of which folders to&nbsp;index, you can select all folders and index them at a time. <br><br>Q. How do I create index for entire device?<br><br>A: If you want to create indexes for entire storage, you can execute:<br>&nbsp;"Create/Maintain index"-&gt;"Create/Remove index manually"-&gt;"scan all files to index"<br>It will scan all folders and show all folders&nbsp;containing any supported file (txt, pdf, epub, docx, xlsx, odt, etc.).<br>And you can create indexes for multiple folders at a time.<br><br>Q. What is the difference between file name index and file content index?<br><br>A. You can refer to "Menu-&gt;Help-&gt;Brief User Guide-&gt;Page 4 - Two type of indexes"<br>It explains the difference between filename index and file content index.<br><br>Q. Do I need to specify the level of the directory hierarchy to start the search.<br><br>A.
You don&#8217;t need to specify any directory, just start searching on the
main screen of this app. This app will search all the indexes you
created.<br><br>Q. After I find the files I want, how can I use them?<br><br>A. <br>1. You can view the contents of these files in plain text mode, and easily locate the search keywords in the file.<br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">a. In brief text mode, you can view a short paragraph of content where all keywords are located<br></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;">b. In the full text mode, you can view the entire content of the document, and easily switch the position between each keyword.<br><br></div>2. You can copy, move, delete or share these files<br><br>3. You can open these files with other external related apps, for example, open PDF files with a PDF reader<br><br>(For more operations on the main screen, please refer to "Menu -&gt; Help -&gt; Brief User Guide -&gt; Page 5")<br><br><img style="width: 426px; height: 768px;" alt="" src="4.png"><br><img style="width: 607px; height: 768px;" alt="" src="5.png"><br><br><img style="width: 426px; height: 768px;" alt="" src="3.png"><br><br>Q.
When I opened a result file&nbsp;with the related app, can DocSearch+
open the file to&nbsp;the keyword position&nbsp;instead of the first
page<br><br>A. There seems to be some misunderstanding, DocSearch&nbsp;
is just a search tool, When it&nbsp;finds result files, and you open
these files with other related apps(not DocSearch+). The related apps
come from&nbsp;other developers. Therefore, DocSearch+ can't control
how they open these files.&nbsp; <br>For example, if you open a pdf
file with "Adobe PDF Reader", only&nbsp;"Adobe PDF Reader" can
decide&nbsp; how to open this file, not DocSearch+.<br><br> </body></html>
