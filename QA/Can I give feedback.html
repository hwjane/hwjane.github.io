Or is there another better way?</big></big><br><hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><br>I
don&#8217;t recommend reporting problems via google play&#8217;s review. Because
it has a word limit and&nbsp;attaching files or screenshots are not
allowed.. Therefore,&nbsp;it&#8217;s impossible&nbsp;to describe things clearly.<br>I
suggest to report the problem directly by email, or you can also report
the problem via "Menu-&gt;Help-&gt;Feedback/Bugs report" in this app.</body></html>
